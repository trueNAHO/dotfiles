# Parse `$dmenu_config_file` and store the result in `$dmenu_flags`. Comments
# match the following regex: `^\s*#`. Any line optionally beginning with any
# amount of whitespace followed by a `#` (pound) is considered a commented line
# and is skipped entirely. Note that inline comments are therefore not possible
# with the current implementation. All fields in non-commented lines are output
# in a single line seperated by a space. Since the final command of this script
# is called with `bash`, this causes  inline comments in the config file to be
# seen as a inline comment for that `bash` command. Therefore any fields after
# the first inline comment will be ignored. The use of inline comments in the
# config file is strongly discouraged.

# `dmenu` is still not found then this script is the only `dmenu`. In that case
# the problem is not this script, but the system.
