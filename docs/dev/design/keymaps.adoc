== Name

dotfiles.dev.design.keymaps - Unified Keymapping Specifications

== Description

Specifies the keymappings-behavior correlation for a unified experience across
applications. However, applications are not required to implement all
keymappings.

== Keymappings-behavior Correlation

=== Window Layout and Movement

Applications may utilize distinct `<LEADER_1>` and `<LEADER_2>` keys to avoid
keymapping conflicts:

.Window Layout and Movement Keymappings-behavior Correlation
|===
| Keymapping | Behaviour

| `<LEADER_1> + <LEADER_2> + SHIFT + h`
| Move the active window to the left

| `<LEADER_1> + <LEADER_2> + SHIFT + j`
| Move the active window down

| `<LEADER_1> + <LEADER_2> + SHIFT + k`
| Move the active window up

| `<LEADER_1> + <LEADER_2> + SHIFT + l`
| Move the active window to the right

| `<LEADER_1> + <LEADER_2> + h`
| Decrease the active window's width

| `<LEADER_1> + <LEADER_2> + j`
| Increase the active window's height

| `<LEADER_1> + <LEADER_2> + k`
| Decrease the active window's height

| `<LEADER_1> + <LEADER_2> + l`
| Increase the active window's width

| `<LEADER_1> + <LEADER_2> + n`
| Apply the next layout

| `<LEADER_1> + <LEADER_2> + p`
| Apply the previous layout

| `<LEADER_1> + SHIFT + j`
| Swap the active window with the next one in the stack

| `<LEADER_1> + SHIFT + k`
| Swap the active window with the previous one in the stack

| `<LEADER_1> + SHIFT + q`
| Close the active window

| `<LEADER_1> + f`
| Toggle the active window's fullscreen state

| `<LEADER_1> + h`
| Focus the previous workspace in the stack

| `<LEADER_1> + j`
| Focus the next window in the stack

| `<LEADER_1> + k`
| Focus the previous window in the stack

| `<LEADER_1> + l`
| Focus the next workspace in the stack

| `<LEADER_1> + t`
