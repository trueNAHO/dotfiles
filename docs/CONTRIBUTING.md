## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other
contributors to high communication standards. By participating and contributing
to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repository via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A
few general guidelines that cover both:

* To report security vulnerabilities, do NOT open an issue. Private message a
  maintainer instead.
* Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
* We work hard to ensure to address issues on time. Depending on the impact, it
  could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the
  comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if
  your issue is blocking.
* Keep in mind that this is a dotfiles repository. Adding features or changing
  visuals might not always get accepted. Open an Issue and wait for feedback
  before getting to work. Improving code and documentation quality is sincerely
  appreciated!

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new
feature, or discuss potential changes before creating a PR.

If you find an Issue that addresses your problem, please add your reproduction
information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a
[reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
can also help indicate to our maintainers that a particular problem is
affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix
or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

* Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread
  whitespace/style issues, not both.
* Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test
  suite already exists).
* Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines possible.
* Include documentation in the repository.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes
(e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal
first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git
workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repository
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can
efficiently review the changes.
