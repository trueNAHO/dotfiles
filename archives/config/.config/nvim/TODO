REFRACTOR ENTIRE CODE. ALSO WRITE ACUTALLY GOOD CODE. THE CURRENT STATES MAKES
IT PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK WITH OR MAKE ANY CHANGES.

Don't forget to read the rest of this here: 'https://www.learncpp.com/'

Add feature to load different settings based on the file type: plain text,
programming. And allow for different settings for each programming language
(python, lua, bash, etc). These settings should be read from file with the
corresponding name of the file type they should match. That way an easy generic
implementation of this feature should be rather easy and is also relatively easy
to use. Although I would prefer to have a single config file for this and split
that file into different sections for each file type we want to manually
configure.
